A nice clean method for setting up ISCE using a single anaconda installation is provided here:
[https://github.com/scottyhq/isce_notes](https://github.com/scottyhq/isce_notes)
You should probably follow the instructions provided in the link above.


The setup of ISCE on your machine is broken down into 3 parts:

1. [Anaconda setup for both python2 and python3](./anaconda.md)
2. [Modules setup for managing environment](./modules.md)
3. [Setting up ISCE](./isceSetup.md)
