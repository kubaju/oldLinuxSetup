A nice clean method for setting up ISCE using a single anaconda installation is provided here:
[https://github.com/scottyhq/isce_notes](https://github.com/scottyhq/isce_notes)
You should probably follow the instructions provided in the link above.


If not, here is an alternate setup that tries to keep installation of python2 and python3 independent.

The setup of ISCE on your machine is broken down into 3 parts:

1. [Anaconda setup for both python2 and python3](./anaconda.md)
2. [Modules setup for managing environment](./modules.md)
3. [Setting up ISCE](./isceSetup.md)
